# sql-refresher

Refreshing my knowledge on SQL because i've been using MongoDB(NoSQL) for several months now, a refresher and with a cheatsheet won't be bad XD
- here I used PHPMyAdmin for testing
- everything in the sql.sql is written step-by-step
- you can follow and learn each step :>
- NOT an IN-DEPTH learning material, just for refresher
- STOP RELYING ON QUERY BUILDERS FUNDAMENTALS EXIST FOR YOUR BENEFIT! <3
